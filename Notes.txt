bootstrap can have themes, take a look at the themes at bootswatch.com

One of the main difference in bootstrap2 and 3 is 3 has grid system introduced.
Its a Mobile first Responsive web design strategy.


Bootstrap screen is always uses 12 columns grid,

col-lg-xx - class used for large screen like desktop (>1200 pixels)
col-md-xx - class used for medium screen like horizontal tablet (>= 992 pixels)
col-sm-xx - class used for small screen size like verticle tablet(>=768 pixels)
col-xs-xx - class used for extra small screen like phone screen (<768 pixels)

We can mention all of them if we want the page being accessible on all the screen sizes,

col-lg-offset-xx - xx mentions the columns to offset
col-md-offset-xx
col-sm-offset-xx
col-xs-offset-xx

We can use all these at the same like above,

pull-right / pull-left : classes will pull the image right/left and if there is any text in the same element then the text will wrap around the image,

img-thumbnail : this class will resize the image as screen size changes and additionally it will put a padding arouund the image to make more appealing style,

hidden-lg - these classes are used on images elements to select if the image should be hidden on particular screen. This is used because we don't want those images to shown in a not so pleasing way on teh screen which is not suitable for that iamge size and type.
hidden-md
hidden-sm

visible-lg - these classes are used on images to show that image(s) on a particular screen size only as opposed to hidden-xx
